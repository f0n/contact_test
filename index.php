		<h3>As a trial attorney or litigator, you need an interpreter that can keep up with your interpreting needs</h3>
		<p>Rush Interpreters' certified court interpreters and professional translators deliver accurate legal translation services for our clients' projects. These are certified linguists who are native to the target language and have substantial experience interpreting in person or translating legal documents.  
		</br></br>We provide qualified people with the education and experience needed for your technical field. When it is required to provide certifiable accuracy, we can because we only assign interpreters that are court certified for these situations. Rush Interpreters reviews the state certification of each of our interpreters to ensure that you have a court certified interpreter for your area. Federally certified interpreters are the gold standard in the industry, which is why we also offer federally certified interpreters.   
		</br></br><em>*Not every language is certifiable in your state.  In California, for instance, the Judicial Council of California certifies 15 languages, thus far. </em></p>
